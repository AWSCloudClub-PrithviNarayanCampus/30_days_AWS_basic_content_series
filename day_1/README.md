What is cloud computing


The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage and process data rather than a local server or a personal computer.

What does this exactly mean

In simpler terms cloud computing uses a network (most often, the internet) to connect users to the cloud platform where they request and access rented computing services.

Lets take another definition of cloud computing

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services like servers, storage, databases, networking, software analytics, and intelligence-over the internet, often on a pay-to-go basis. Instead of storing data and running applications on local devices or servers, users access these resources remotely through the internet.


Before understanding what is cloud computing is lets dig a bit about what servers are.
What is a server.
A server is a computer or program that provides services to other computers, called clients. It can refer to a physical machine or a software program. Servers are designed to handle requests from multiple clients simultaneously, making resources like files, applications, and data accessible to many users. 

Now lets understand what a cloud server is 


A simple cloud server definition is cloud servers are virtual (not physical) servers running in a cloud computing environment that can be accessed on demand by unlimited users. Cloud servers work just like physical servers and they perform similar functions like storing data and running applications.

Difference between server and cloud
The key difference lies in how resources are accessed and managed: cloud services are accessed over the internet and managed by a provider, while servers can be local or remote and may be managed by the user or a provider. 


Features of cloud computing
*On-demand access:
Cloud computing allows users to access computing resources as needed, paying only for what they use. 
*Remote infrastructure:
Instead of managing physical servers and infrastructure, cloud computing providers handle these resources remotely in their data centers. 

Everyday examples:

Examples of cloud computing in everyday life include using services like Google Drive, iCloud, Netflix, or online gaming.
